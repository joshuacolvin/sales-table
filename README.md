# Running the application

This application uses JavaScript modules which will not work on the local file system. A server like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) should be used instead:

```bash
npx serve
```

A hosted version of the application can also be found [here](https://dreamy-mahavira-c6e346.netlify.app/)
